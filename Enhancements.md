The enhancements we chose to implement includes
- An added visual representation for blocking for the actor's view. This makes it easier for actors to visualize where they should be on stage.
- A new user group: production manager who is responsible to managing the castings and sound for the production

In the manager view, the manager will be able to:
- view the castings for each script, given the script id and clicking on the "castings" button
- view the chosen music/sound on stage for each part given the script id
- make changes to the castings and/or music/sound by modifying the text field and clicking "update"

All the changes that the production manager has made will also be reflected on the director's view.
